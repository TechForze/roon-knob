# Claude Agent Instructions

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for complete instructions on working with this project.

## Key Points

- This project uses **Beads (bd)** for all task and issue management
- Initialize once per clone: `bd init --quiet`
- Core workflow: check `bd ready`, claim tasks, sync when done
- Always run `bd sync` at the end of a session
- No external trackers, no Markdown TODOs
